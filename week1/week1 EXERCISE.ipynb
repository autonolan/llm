       "# AWS Solutions Report for a Small Web Application\n",
       "\n",
       "This report outlines recommended AWS services for a small web application suited for 5 to 10 users, focusing on cost-effectiveness and development complexity.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Recommended AWS Services\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Overview**: EC2 provides scalable virtual servers in the AWS Cloud, allowing businesses to run applications by launching and connecting to virtual instances.\n",
       "- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with AWS services like Amazon RDS (for database needs), Amazon S3 (for storage), and AWS Lambda (for serverless applications).\n",
       "- **Scalability**: Easily scales by adding new instances as demand grows. Can adjust instance types based on performance needs.\n",
       "- **Cost**: You can potentially operate within the AWS Free Tier for up to 12 months, which provides t2.micro or t3.micro instances at no charge (if eligible). After that, costs depend on usage.\n",
       "- **Development Complexity**: Moderate; requires understanding of instance configurations, security groups, and networking. Some setup and management are required.\n",
       "- **Long-Term Support**: Supported by AWS with extensive documentation and tutorials available.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Overview**: S3 is an object storage service that offers high durability, scalability, and availability for data storage.\n",
       "- **Integration**: Integrates well with EC2 for static file hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless applications, and Amazon CloudFront for content delivery.\n",
       "- **Scalability**: Automatically scales storage as needed without an upper limit.\n",
       "- **Cost**: Pay as you go pricing model based on storage used, requests made, and data transferred. S3 offers a free tier for the first 5 GB of storage.\n",
       "- **Development Complexity**: Low; easy to implement with SDKs available for various programming languages.\n",
       "- **Long-Term Support**: Long-term support with extensive resources and best practices documentation.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Overview**: An managed service that simplifies setup, operation, and scaling of relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.\n",
       "- **Integration**: Works smoothly with EC2 instances for web applications that require persistent data storage.\n",
       "- **Scalability**: Easily scales storage and compute resources as application demands change.\n",
       "- **Cost**: While not covered in the Free Tier, RDS offers low-cost instance classes suitable for small applications (e.g., db.t3.micro).\n",
       "- **Development Complexity**: Moderate; requires some understanding of database management, but AWS takes care of backups, patching, and replication concerns.\n",
       "- **Long-Term Support**: Fully supported by AWS with continuous improvements and robust documentation.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. **AWS Lambda**\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Overview**: A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events, without provisioning servers.\n",
       "- **Integration**: Can be connected with various AWS services such as S3, DynamoDB, and API Gateway.\n",
       "- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling based on the number of requests, ideal for applications with variable workloads.\n",
       "- **Cost**: Charged based on the number of requests and the duration of code execution. There is a free tier of 1 million requests and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time monthly.\n",
       "- **Development Complexity**: Low; ideal for event-driven applications. Minimal management required, focusing on code rather than infrastructure.\n",
       "- **Long-Term Support**: Continual support from AWS, with evolving features and extensive community and documentation.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Summary Table\n",
       "\n",
       "| Service    | Cost  | Development Complexity | Scalability   | Long-Term Support |\n",
       "|------------|-------|------------------------|---------------|-------------------|\n",
       "| Amazon EC2 | Free Tier (if eligible), otherwise pay-as-you-go | Moderate                       | High          | Yes               |\n",
       "| Amazon S3  | Free Tier (5 GB), pay-as-you-go thereafter | Low                           | Unlimited     | Yes               |\n",
       "| Amazon RDS | Low-cost tier, not in Free Tier | Moderate                       | High          | Yes               |\n",
       "| AWS Lambda  | Free Tier (1M requests), pay-as-you-go | Low                           | Automatic     | Yes               |\n",
       "\n",
       "## Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "For a small web application targeting 5 to 10 users, leveraging a combination of **Amazon EC2**, **Amazon S3**, **Amazon RDS**, and **AWS Lambda** provides a balanced architecture that is cost-efficient, scalable, and backed by robust support from AWS."
